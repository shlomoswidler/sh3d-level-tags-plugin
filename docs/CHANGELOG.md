### Known Limitations

#### Version 1.0.0
- No direct context menu integration on level tabs (Sweet Home 3D API limitation)
- Tags limited to String type only (no rich metadata)
- No built-in tag categories or hierarchies
- Single-level undo/redo (not integrated with Sweet Home 3D's undo system)
- No tag import/export functionality
- No visual customization of tags (colors, icons)

#### Sweet Home 3D Integration Constraints
- Plugin actions only appear in main menu/toolbar
- Cannot extend existing context menus
- Limited access to internal UI components
- No hooks for custom level tab rendering
- Must work within Java Swing UI framework

### Future Enhancement Ideas

#### Version 1.1.0 (Planned)
- Additional localization (French, German, Spanish)

#### Version 1.2.0 (Planned)  
- Integration with level copying operations

### Architecture Decisions

#### Data Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Store tags as comma-separated strings in Level custom properties
**Rationale**: 
- Ensures compatibility with Sweet Home 3D file format
- No external dependencies or complex serialization
- Forward-compatible with future versions
- Survives plugin removal

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate XML file (rejected: sync issues, file management complexity)
- Binary serialization (rejected: version compatibility issues)  
- Database storage (rejected: deployment complexity)

#### UI Framework Approach
**Decision**: Custom Swing dialogs launched from main menu
**Rationale**:
- Works within Sweet Home 3D plugin architecture constraints
- Provides full control over UI layout and behavior
- Familiar Swing patterns for Sweet Home 3D users
- Allows rich interaction models

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Context menu integration (rejected: API limitations)
- Toolbar-only interface (rejected: too limited)
- Web-based UI (rejected: complexity, security concerns)

#### Tag Storage Format
**Decision**: Simple comma-separated string format
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable in property inspection
- Easy to parse and manipulate
- Minimal storage overhead
- Compatible with CSV export/import

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JSON format (rejected: overkill for simple strings)
- XML format (rejected: verbose, parsing overhead)
- Binary format (rejected: not human-readable)

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Tag parsing and validation logic
- Data model operations (add, remove, query)
- Bulk operation algorithms
- Error handling and edge cases

#### Integration Testing  
- Plugin loading and initialization
- Sweet Home 3D API integration
- File persistence across save/load cycles
- UI component interactions

#### User Acceptance Testing
- Workflow validation with real home files
- Performance testing with large numbers of levels
- Cross-platform compatibility verification
- Accessibility and usability testing
